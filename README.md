# Web Scraping - Selenium
Technology used: python, beautiful soup, pandas

I just found a good data source of weather info and food prices in Indonesia. I decided to use Selenium to try and extract data and create a dataset with all weather info and food prices in Indonesia.

## Python file

The whole web scraping process was performed using Selenium library [*BMKG_Scraper.py*](), [*PIHPS_scraper.py*]().

## Output

Output file in form dataset as .csv file [*isi nanti*]().

The new created dataset was used to further analysis.
