# Web Scraping - Selenium
Technology used: python, beautiful soup, pandas

I just found a good data source of weather info and food prices in Indonesia. I decided to use Selenium to try and extract data and create a dataset with all weather info and food prices in Indonesia.

## Python file

The whole web scraping process was performed using Selenium library [*BMKG_Scraper.py*](https://github.com/Xedonedron/web-scraping/blob/main/BMKG_Scraper.py), [*BMKG_API.py*](https://github.com/Xedonedron/web-scraping/blob/main/BMKG_API.py), [*PIHPS_scraper.py*](https://github.com/Xedonedron/web-scraping/blob/main/PIHPS_scraper.py).

## Output

Output file in form dataset as .csv and .json file for [*Weather Info*](https://github.com/Xedonedron/web-scraping/tree/main/Weather%20Info), and [*Food Prices Info*](https://github.com/Xedonedron/web-scraping/tree/main/Food%20Prices%20Info).

The new created dataset can used to further analysis.
